# Face Detection and Recognition

This project implements a **Face Detection and Recognition system** using **Python and OpenCV**.  
It detects human faces from images or live camera input and recognizes known faces using a trained model.

---

##  Features

- Detects faces using **Haar Cascade Classifier**
- Collects face data using webcam
- Trains a recognition model
- Recognizes faces in real time
- Modular and easy-to-understand Python scripts

---

## Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Machine Learning
- Haar Cascade Classifier

## Dataset Note

- The `images/` folder is **intentionally ignored** in this repository.
- Users should create their own dataset inside the `images/` directory before running the project.

---

## Future Improvements

- Improve accuracy using deep learning (CNN)
- Add a GUI interface
- Support multiple users
- Deploy as a web application
